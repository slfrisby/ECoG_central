## Data acquisition and access
These data were collected at Kyoto University by Professor Riki Matsumoto's team. In their anonymised form, they can be transferred between Kyoto University, the University of Cambridge and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The collaboration agreement between Cambridge and UW-Madison (`RG97578 (#17838) FEA - University of Wisconsin-Madison (fbMRC).pdf`) should be stored alongside these data. The contact person at Cambridge is Saskia Frisby (saskia.frisby@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk, 0000-0002-5786-6900). The data should not be used outside those institutions without permission from Professor Riki Matsumoto. 

## Overview
The data are suitable for various kinds of decoding. The tasks are:
- Naming line drawings of 50 animate and 50 inanimate objects. Each stimulus was presented for 5 seconds, with no break.
- Semantic judgement (living/nonliving) of images and nonverbal sounds
Data quality: note that human intracranial data are acquired from patients undergoing surgery for intractable epilepsy. These data therefore contain seizure activity and interictal (between-seizure) activity, limiting their generalisability to healthy populations. 

## Methods
There are 19 patients with intracranial electrodes - electrocortigography (ECoG) electrodes, which sit on the cortical surface, or both ECoG and sEEG (stereotactic electroencephalography) electrodes, which penetrate the cortex. Details of data acquisition for the naming dataset are available in a 2025 preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.17.649404v2.full . 
Additional data acquired: T1-weighted anatomical MRI scans were acquired before and after data acquisition. These data are stored in Kyoto and are not available at Cambridge or UW-Madison.
