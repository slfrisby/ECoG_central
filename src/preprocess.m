        % WindowStart and WindowSize
        % We wish to generate one big window per trial (rather than a moving 
        % or opening window). The window of interest for later analysis is 
        % 0:1650 ms (where 0 is stimulus onset) but we need a buffer so 
        % that any edge artefacts lie outside the window of interest. We 
        % also want to avoid overlap because we want to run ICA later. We 
        % therefore select -1000:3000 ms.
    
        % BaselineWindow
        % This is set to match the voltage analysis of the same data. It is
        % not perfect because the previous stimulus was still onscreen.
        % Additionally, some advise the use of a baseline that stops well
        % before stimulus onset to avoid bleeding of activity into the
        % pretrial period. However, it is important that these results are
        % comparable with previous work, so we select a baseline of -200 ms
        % until stimulus onset.
    
        % subjects
        % We wish to proces one dataset at a time. 
    
        % boxcar
        % This defines the number of MILISECONDS over which the data is
        % averaged. For example, if the data were sampled at 2000 Hz and we 
        % had the following timeseries:
        % [2, 4, 6, 8];
        % A boxcar average of 1 ms would down-sample to 1000 Hz and yield:
        % [3, 7];
        % Note that, because this parameter is defined in miliseconds
        % rather than in data points, the effect depends on the sampling
        % rate. We set boxcar = 1 so that data collected at 2000 Hz will be
        % downsampled to match data collected at 1000 Hz (which will be
        % unaffected).
    
        % slope_interval
        % If slope interval > 0, results describe rate of change in voltage rather
        % than voltage value.
